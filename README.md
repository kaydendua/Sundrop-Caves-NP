# Sundrop-Caves-NP
Python game about mining that I made for an assignment. It uses txt and json files to store data, and allows you to save and load games from different save slots. You explore a dark mine covered in fog that gradually reveals itself as you explore, and you can upgrade your equipment to mine more ores. It also features random map generation and settings.
